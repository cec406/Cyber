Simple .bat file that runs several pictures and opens cmd prompts. I have it set up so all files are hidden, and the .bat shortcut shows a DVD icon. 
This can be made more 'malicious' by opening notepads or terminals on a never ending loop to crash the machine. This is not set up this way currently.
